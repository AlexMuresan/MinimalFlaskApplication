# Minimal Flask Webapp

This is an example / template / experiment for learning and designing
a portfolio like website for showcasing my data science work.

The app can be run using

>`flask --app app run --debug`

where `--debug` updates the app when the code is changed and `app`
is the name of the main python file.
